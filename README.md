# Sword_Detection
To create an automated system capable of detecting potential weapons, specifically swords and rods, in real-time during instances of civil unrest. This initiative aims to bolster public safety and assist law enforcement agencies, especially in developing countries, where rapid response and intervention are paramount.
Technologies Used:

YOLO V3 and V5: These versions of the "You Only Look Once" (YOLO) real-time object detection system were employed due to their efficiency and accuracy. The choice of two versions allowed for comparison and ensemble, ensuring robust detection.
Key Features:

Real-Time Detection: The system operates in real-time, allowing law enforcement to promptly respond to threats and manage volatile situations.
Robust Accuracy: Leveraging the power of YOLO's architecture, the model detects potential weapons with high precision, minimizing false positives and negatives.
Optimized for Dynamic Environments: Given the unpredictable nature of civil unrest, the model was trained on diverse datasets to ensure it performs well in various scenarios, including different lighting conditions, crowd densities, and weapon orientations.
Outcome & Significance:
The weapon detection system has the potential to greatly enhance the safety measures during civil disturbances. By providing an early warning system, it can:

Aid law enforcement in pinpointing potential threats and taking preventive action.
Assist in decision-making for crowd management and controlling escalating situations.
Potentially reduce the risk of injuries and loss of life by alerting authorities to immediate threats.
Future Directions:

Expansion of Detected Objects: The project could be expanded to detect other potential threats, like firearms or explosive devices.
Integration with Surveillance Systems: Collaborating with municipalities or private entities to integrate this system into existing CCTV and surveillance infrastructures for a wider coverage area.
Improving Real-Time Processing: Working on optimization to ensure the system operates smoothly even in areas with heavy crowd movement and numerous objects to track.
